# Algorithmic Trading Bot

This project aims to create an algorithmic trading bot using Python. The bot will simulate and execute trading strategies on real-time market data.

## Steps

### Step 1: Live Simulated Chart (Done)

In the first step, we created a live updating chart using random numbers to simulate data. This helps us understand how to visualize real-time data and provides a foundation for integrating actual market data.

### Step 2: Real-Time Chart Data

Next, we will replace the random numbers with real-time data from a financial API. This will involve fetching live market data and updating the chart accordingly.

### Step 3: Research Strategies

We will research various trading strategies, including technical analysis, machine learning-based strategies, and others, to determine which ones to implement.

### Step 4: Import Strategies and Backtest

We will import the researched strategies into our program and backtest them using historical data to determine their win percentages and overall effectiveness.
